As a customer, I want to be able to add items to my shopping cart so I can purchase them when I'm done shopping.
As a student, I want to be able to browse a list of all courses currently offered on campus so that I can identify the courses I want to enroll in.
As a player, I want to be informed when it is my turn in the game so that I don't have to keep track on my own.
